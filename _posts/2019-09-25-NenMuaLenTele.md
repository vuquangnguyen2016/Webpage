 ## Nikon 55-300mm VR vs Tamron 70-300mm VC "USD" - choose 

 <p>
     <blockquote>
        I would have thought any comparison should include the Nikon 70-300 as well?. I am very interested in getting a new inexpensive 70-300 lens for basic sports photography so fast autofocus on my D80 is essential.

    If you look closely at the Amazon Tamron 70-300 page you linked to, you'll see that Tamron is offering a $50 rebate on this lens, so the price is the same as the Nikon. You don't need to pay $50 more for the Tamron.

    <br>

    So, the main differences are the zoom range (though the difference between 55 and 70 is pretty irrelevant to me), focus speed, rotating (Nikon) vs. non-rotating (Tamron) front element, size, and weight.

    I played with both of these lenses as well as the Nikon 70-300 at the store yesterday. The Tamron seemed very close to the Nikon 70-300 in every way but price (the Tamron is ~$200 less) and better than the Nikon 55-300 in several respects. For my purposes, the only advantages of the Nikon 55-300 were the considerably smaller size and weight. If these are not a concern, and if you don't mind losing the 55-70 range, the Tamron seems like a no-brainer. It struck me as a VERY nice lens for the price.

        Nikon's 70-300 is probably the champ of the three. But it is considerably more expensive. I really like what i see from the two less expensive lenses though and the Tamron is a reasonably fast focusing lens for a change. Something that one can't say about most of Tamron's lenses.

        <br>

        That said, the AF-S on the Nikon 70-300 is probably the fastest of the three. Also for Sports photography, the Nikon 70-300 does have an environment seal on the mount that affords a little better seal in moist or dusty situations. I have never seen this on a Tamron lens and I don't recall seeing it on the 55-300 when I tested it at the dealer the other day.

        Tamron's VC version of stabilization is truly amazing and beats Nikon and Canon. However, that is not that much of an advantage when shooting sports as you really do need to turn stabilization off above 1/500 anyway.

        Seeing the early reviews of the Tamron and the Nikon 55-300, I'd say that both are really good optically for their price point. If you are going to use it a lot hand-held and you are not going to be doing FX, then the Nikon lens is significantly lighter. One thing I did notice when trying out the 55-300. There is a slight resistance when zooming from low to high at around 200 to 220mm. Tried three different samples with the same results. Not really a big deal, but it might bug some folks.

        Just some thoughts to consider. Good luck all.
